This was a stronger decrease than expected by the IMF, which underestimated China's population decrease already in 2022. China arrived at the turning point of its population growth earlier than expected by many observers, and current IMF estimates for the total population until 2029 very likely need to be adjusted downwards.\n\nPopulation development in China\nChina had for a long time been the country with the , but according to UN estimates, it has been overtaken by India in 2023. As , the country is very likely to remain being home of the largest population on earth in the near future. Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people, population growth has subsided over the past decades, displaying an of -0.15 percent in 2023. Nevertheless, compared to the in total, China held a share of about 18 percent of the overall global population in 2022.\n\nIn terms of demographic developments, the birth control efforts of the Chinese government had considerable effects on the demographic pyramid in China. Upon closer examination of the , a clear trend of an becomes visible. In order to curb the negative effects of an aging population, the Chinese government abolished the one-child policy in 2015, which had been in effect since 1979, and introduced a three-child policy in May 2021. However, many Chinese parents nowadays are reluctant to have a second or third child, as is the case in most of the developed countries in the world. The varied in the years following the abolishment of the one-child policy, but did not increase considerably. Among the reasons most prominent for parents not having more children are the rising living costs and costs for child care, growing work pressure, a growing trend towards self-realization and individualism, and changing social behaviors."

This reflects the increasingly ageing population of Singapore, a significant demographical shift that will have long-lasting socio-economic repercussions. \n\nLiving longer\u2026\nThe improvements in health care and quality of life has led to Singapore having one of the highest life expectancies in the world. Coupled with one of the lowest fertility rate globally, Singapore society faces a crisis of ageing. The average age of its resident population is projected to increase to just under 53 years old by 2050.\n\n\n\nThe prospect of an ageing population is worrying for a country whose most important resource is its people. The current retirement age of 62 would no longer be tenable when close to half the population is expected to be aged 65 years or older by 2050. There is already a trend of elderly workers re-entering the workforce, be it to keep themselves occupied or to support themselves financially. The share of the population who would be working well into old age looks set to increase in the future, as a majority of Singaporeans have indicated that they were not .\n\nSingapore is well-known for its emphasis on career and shunning welfare policies; however, there is an urgent need to rethink and overhaul its social security and medical care systems to weather the silver tsunami that is set to engulf the island state."

Apart from the information given on broad age groups in this statistic, some more information is provided by a timeline for the age distribution and a population breakdown by smaller age groups.\n\nDemographic development in China\nChina ranked as the second most populous country in the world with a population of nearly 1.41 billion as of mid 2023, surpassed only by India. As the world population reached nearly eight billion in mid 2022, China represented almost one fifth of the global population. China's population increased exponentially between the 1950s and the early 1980s due to Mao Zedong's population policy. To tackle the problem of overpopulation, a one-child policy was implemented in 1979. Since then, has slowed from more than two percent per annum in the 1970s to around 0.5 percent per annum in the 2000s.\n\nOne outcome of the strict population policy is the acceleration of demographic aging trends. According to the United Nations, had more than doubled over the last five decades, from 18 years in 1970 to 37.4 years in 2020. Few countries have aged faster than China. The dramatic aging of the population is matched by slower growth. The total fertility rate, measuring the number of children a woman can expect to have in her life, stood at just around 1.6 children. This incremental decline in labor force could lead to future challenges for the Chinese government, causing instability in current health care and social insurance mechanisms.

A breakdown of the population by broad age groups reveals that around 62 percent of the total population was in working age between 16 and 59 years in 2022. Age cohorts below 25 years were considerably smaller, although there was a slight growth trend in recent years.\n\nPopulation development in China\nPopulation development in China over the past decades has been strongly influenced by political and economic factors. After a time of high fertility rates during the Maoist regime, China introduced birth-control measures in the 1970s, including the so-called one-child policy. The dropped accordingly from around six children per woman in the 1960s to below two at the end of the 20th century. At the same time, increased consistently. In the face of a the government gradually lifted the one-child policy after 2012, finally arriving at a three-child policy in 2021. However, like in most other developed countries nowadays, people in China are reluctant to have more than one or two children due to high costs of living and education, as well as changed social norms and private values.\n\nThe above-mentioned developments are clearly reflected in the Chinese age pyramid. The age cohorts between 30 and 39 years are the last two larger age cohorts. The cohorts between 15 and 24, which now enter childbearing age, are decisively smaller, which will have a negative effect on the in the coming decade. When looking at a a considerable gender gap among the younger age cohorts becomes visible, leaving even less room for growth in birth figures."

The mortality rate in China displayed an uneven development over the last two decades. This is mainly related to the very uneven sizes of Chinese age groups, improvements in health care, and the occurrence of epidemics. However, an overall growing trend is undisputable and related to China's aging population. As the share of the population aged 60 and above will be growing significantly over the upcoming two decades, the mortality rate will further increase in the years ahead.\n\nPopulation in China\nChina was the second in 2023. However, due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people, has subsided over the past decades and finally turned negative in 2022. The major factor for this development was a set of policies introduced by the Chinese government in 1979, including the so-called one-child policy, which was intended to improve people\u2019s living standards by limiting the population growth. However, with the decreasing birth rate and slower population growth, China nowadays is facing the problems of a rapidly .\n\nAccording to the one-child policy, a married couple was only allowed to have one child. Only under certain circumstances were parents allowed to have a second child. As the performance of family control had long been related to the assessment of local government\u2019s achievements, violations of the rule were severely punished. The birth control in China led to a decreasing and a more skewed due to a widely preference for male children in the Chinese society. Nowadays, since China\u2019s population is aging rapidly, the one-child policy has been re-considered as an obstacle for the country\u2019s further economic development. Since 2014, the one-child policy has been gradually relaxed and fully eliminated at the end of 2015. In May 2021, a new three-child policy has been introduced. However, many young Chinese people today are not willing to have more children due to high costs of raising a child, especially in urban areas."

In 2021, approximately 9.56 million inhabitants lived in the UAE.\n\nPopulation of the United Arab Emirates\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) have undergone extreme demographic changes over the past decade. With the increasing developments, tourism and global recognition of cities in the UAE like Abu Dhabi and Dubai, it is to no surprise that the total population has grown by about 6 million people over the past decade. However, the majority of the total population of the UAE are expatriates. Any expatriate having lived in the UAE for a minimum of 20 years can apply for a citizenship, consequently, the growing total population is mainly due to the growing number of expatriates who become citizens and the high number of immigrants which gives the UAE the world\u2019s highest net migration rate. This becomes evident when looking at the , the average rate of children born per fertile woman in a year in the UAE, which has been steadily declining over the last decade.\n\n, however, has been increasing steadily over the same time span. It is interesting to note that, despite this increase, total population of the UAE consists mainly of people , another fact pointing towards expatriates and immigrants contributing to the increasing numbers."

The country is also one of the most populated countries in the world, trailing only China and India. The United States' economy prospers primarily due to having a plentiful amount of natural resources and advanced infrastructure to cope with the production of goods and services, as well as the population and workforce to enable high productivity. Efficient productivity led to a slight almost every year over the past decade, despite undergoing several economic hardships towards the late 2000's.\n\nIn addition, the United States holds arguably one of the most important financial markets, with the majority of countries around the world having commercial connections with American companies. Dependency on a single market like the United States has however caused several global dilemmas, most evidently seen during the 2008 financial crisis.

In 1990, this figure was 4.16 million. \n\nBirth and replacement rates\n\nA country\u2019s birth rate is defined as the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants, and it is this particularly important number that has been decreasing over the past few decades. The declining birth rate is not solely an American problem,\n\nAdditionally, each country has what is called a \u201creplacement rate.\u201d The replacement rate is the rate of fertility needed to keep a population stable . In the U.S., the fertility rate needed to keep the population stable is around 2.1 children per woman, but .\n\n\n\nCurrently, there is much discussion as to what exactly is causing the birth rate to decrease in the United States. There seem to be several factors in play, , , and an increased focus on careers, all of which are causing people to wait longer to start a family. How international governments will handle falling populations remains to be seen, but what is clear is that the declining birth rate is a multifaceted problem without an easy solution."

In the same period, the annual growth rate of the population has been constantly set at roughly 2.5 percent, with a peak of 2.62 percent in 2014. The reasons behind this rapid growth are various. One factor is the high registered in African countries. In 2021, a woman in Niger had an average of over 6.8 children in her reproductive years, the highest rate on the continent. High fertility resulted in a large young population and partly compensated for the high mortality rate in Africa, leading to fast-paced population growth. "

The average salary in South Korea showed a general trend of positive growth within the given period. The monthly wage was projected to reach over 5,400 U.S. dollars in 2040, the highest value among the surveyed countries.\nWork-life balance\nSouth Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world. Although working hours in the country have decreased over the past decade and measures such as flexible working hours have been implemented to promote a better work-life balance, South Korea still ranks among the top five in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as of 2022. Many South Koreans tend to prefer working for a company that offers a good work-life balance rather than a company that offers a higher salary. This preference is especially strong among parents."

The significant drop in 2021 and 2022 was mainly due to people leaving the island during the coronavirus pandemic, while the natural growth rate was also slightly negative. The return of many people in 2023 led to a growth in population. According to national statistics and projections, population numbers entered a general declining path in 2020.\n\nTaiwan's demographic development\nTaiwan experienced rapid population growth in the 1950s and 60s, but alongside with economic development, growth rates decreased significantly. Falling birth figures have also been attributed to Taiwan\u2019s family planning policy, which was aimed at keeping population growth at check. This led to a situation on the island where overall was very high and still growing, while the dropped quickly and eventually reached . In the 21st century, the challenges of a quickly aging society became more and more apparent and the government initiated family friendly and birth promoting policies. However, fertility still kept on decreasing and reached a historical low in 2010 at 0.9 births per woman on average, and only in recent years has the number of births increased slightly.\n\nToday's Taiwan, like many East Asian societies, faces the challenges of a rapidly aging population. While the accounted to around 18 percent in 2022, it is projected to reach 41 percent in 2060. The , which denotes the relation of people of 65 years and above to the working-age population, is expected to reach around 83 percent in those years. This puts heavy pressure on the working people and the economy as a whole. However, compared to mainland China, which is in a very much comparable demographic situation, Taiwan enjoys the advantage of a relatively wealthy society, which helps to curb the negative economic effects of an aging population."

Although it took thousands of years to reach one billion people, it did so at the beginning of a phenomenon known as the demographic transition; from this point onwards, population growth has skyrocketed, and since the 1960s the population has increased by one billion people every 12 to 15 years. The demographic transition sees a sharp drop in mortality due to factors such as vaccination, sanitation, and improved food supply; the population boom that follows is due to increased survival rates among children and higher life expectancy among the general population; and fertility then drops in response to this population growth."

            "Description": "In the past four centuries, the population of the United States has grown from a recorded 350 people around the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1610, to an estimated 331 million people in 2020. The pre-colonization populations of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have proven difficult for historians to estimate, as their numbers decreased rapidly following the introduction of European diseases (namely smallpox, plague and influenza). Native Americans were also omitted from most censuses conducted before the twentieth century, therefore the actual population of what we now know as the United States would have been much higher than the official census data from before 1800, but it is unclear by how much. Population growth in the colonies throughout the eighteenth century has primarily been attributed to migration from the British Isles and the Transatlantic slave trade; however it is also difficult to assert the ethnic-makeup of the population in these years as accurate migration records were not kept until after the 1820s, at which point the importation of slaves had also been illegalized.\n\nIn the year 1800, it is estimated that the population across the present-day United States was around six million people, with the population in the numbering at 5.3 million. Migration to the United States began to happen on a large scale in the mid-nineteenth century, with the first major waves coming from , and . In some aspects, this wave of mass migration balanced out the demographic impacts of the , which was with approximately 620 thousand fatalities between 1861 and 1865. The civil war also resulted in the emancipation of ; many of whose ancestors would take part in the Great Northern Migration in the early 1900s, which saw around six million black Americans migrate away from the south in one of the largest demographic shifts in U.S. history. By the end of the nineteenth century, improvements in transport technology and increasing economic opportunities saw migration to the United States increase further, particularly from southern and Eastern Europe, and in the first decade of the 1900s the number of migrants to the U.S. exceeded one million people in some years.\n\nThe U.S. population has grown steadily throughout the past 120 years, reaching one hundred million in the 1910s, two hundred million in the 1960s, and three hundred million in 2007. In the past century, the U.S. established itself as a global superpower, with the world's largest economy (by nominal GDP) and most powerful military. Involvement in foreign wars has resulted in over 620,000 further U.S. fatalities since the Civil War, and migration fell drastically during the World Wars and Great Depression; however the population continuously grew in these years as the , and (except during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918).\n\nSince the Second World War, Latin America has replaced Europe as the most common point of origin for migrants, with Hispanic populations growing rapidly across the south and border states. Because of this, the proportion of non-Hispanic whites, which has been the most dominant ethnicity in the U.S. since records began, has dropped more rapidly in recent decades. Ethnic minorities also have a much higher than non-Hispanic whites, further contributing to this decline, and the share of non-Hispanic whites is expected to fall below fifty percent of the U.S. population by the mid-2000s. In 2020, the United States has the third-largest population in the world (after China and India), and the population is ."

Household debt mainly includes loans, primarily home mortgages, and other types of liabilities such as consumer credit (e.g. credit card debt, automobile loans). A ratio above 100 percent indicates that the debt owed is greater than the annual disposable income."

            "Description": "The 2021 Northern Ireland Census marked the first time since records began where the Catholic share of the population was larger than the combined Protestant share. In 2021, over 42 percent of the population classified themselves as Catholic or from a Catholic background, in comparison with 37 percent classified as Protestant or from a Protestant background. Additionally, the share of the population with no religion (or those who did not answer) was 19 percent; larger than any individual Protestant denomination. This marks a significant shift in demographic and societal trends over the past century, as Protestants outnumbered Catholics by roughly 2:1 when Northern Ireland was established in the 1920s. Given the Catholic community's historic tendency to be in favor of a united Ireland, many look to the changing religious composition of the population when assessing the potential for Irish reunification.\n\nA major development in the history of British rule in ireland was the in the 1600s, where much of the land in the north (historically the most rebellious region) was seized from Irish Catholics and given to Protestant settlers from Britain (predominantly Scots). This helped establish Protestant dominance in the north, created a large section of the population loyal to the British crown, and saw a distinct Ulster-Scots identity develop over time. In the 1920s, the republican movement won independence for 26 of Ireland's 32 counties, however, the six counties in Ulster with the largest Protestant populations remained part of the UK, as Northern Ireland. Following partition, structural inequalities between Northern Ireland's Protestant and Catholic communities meant that the Protestant population was generally wealthier, better educated, more politically empowered, and had better access to housing, among other advantages. In the 1960s, a civil rights movement then emerged for equal rights and status for both sides of the population, but this quickly turned violent and escalated into a the three-decade long conflict now known as .\n\nThe Troubles was largely fought between (mostly Catholic), (mostly Protestant), and (including ). This is often described as a religious conflict, however it is more accurately described as an ethnic and political conflict, where the Catholic community generally favored Northern Ireland's reunification with the rest of the island, while the Protestant community wished to remain in the UK. Paramilitaries had a large amount of support from their respective communities in the early years of the Troubles, but this waned as the conflict progressed into the 1980s and 1990s. Demographic and societal trends influenced the religious composition of Northern Ireland's population in these decades, as the Catholic community had higher fertility rates than Protestant communities, while the growing secularism has coincided with a decline in those identifying as Protestant - the dip in those identifying as Catholic in the 1970s and 1980s was due to a protest and boycott of the Census. The Troubles came to an end in 1998, and divisions between both sides of the community have drastically fallen, although they have not disappeared completely."

Between 2003 and 2011, the annual number of deaths in the UK fell from 612,085 to just over 552,232. Since 2011 however, the annual number of annual deaths in the United Kingdom has steadily grown, with the number recorded in 2020, the highest since 1918 when there were 715,246 deaths. Both of these spikes in the number of deaths can be attributed to infectious disease pandemics. The great influenza pandemic of 1918, which was at its height towards the end of World War One, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a large number of deaths in 2020."

Since the 1970s, the has remained fairly constant. While there was a slight rise in the in 2021, the also increased for the first time in almost ten years. The fact that the birth rate is almost double the size of its death rate gives the country one of the highest natural population growth rates of any high-income country.  "

As of July 2021, online penetration in the country stood at around 70 percent. Popular online activities included mobile messaging and social media. The most popular social network in Indonesia was Whatsapp, with around 89 percent of the online population using the platform.

This rating is due to blocked political and social content as well as various restrictions and violations of user rights, most notably through the governmental passing of the Law on Information and Electronic Transactions (ITE Law). The ITE law holds strong penalties such as prison sentences and high fines for anybody convicted of online defamation charges. This law has also been applied to blog posts and Facebook comments and has lead to self-censorship among online writers and internet users as well as an increasingly tense online atmosphere."

An estimated 101.3 infants per 1,000 live births died in the first year of life in Afghanistan in 2024. \n\nInfant and child mortality\n\nInfant mortality usually refers to the death of children younger than one year. Child mortality, which is often used synonymously with infant mortality, is the death of children younger than five. Among the main causes are pneumonia, diarrhea \u2013 which causes dehydration \u2013 and infections in newborns, with malnutrition also posing a severe problem. As can be seen above, most countries with a high infant mortality rate are developing countries or emerging countries, most of which are located in Africa. Good health care and hygiene are crucial in reducing child mortality; among the are exclusively developed countries, whose inhabitants usually have access to clean water and comprehensive health care. Access to vaccinations, antibiotics and a balanced nutrition also help reducing child mortality in these regions.\n\nIn some countries, infants are killed if they turn out to be of a certain gender. , for example, is known as a country where a lot of girls are aborted or killed right after birth, as they are considered to be too expensive for poorer families, who traditionally have to pay a costly dowry on the girl\u2019s wedding day. Interestingly, the global mortality rate among boys is higher than that for girls, which could be due to the fact that more male infants are actually born than female ones. Other theories include a stronger immune system in girls, or more premature births among boys."

A look at the development of the world population since the beginning of the Common Era shows that such a surge in numbers is unprecedented. The first significant rise in population occurred during the 14th century, after the Black Death had killed approximately 25 million people worldwide. Subsequently, the global population increased slowly but steadily until it reached record numbers between 1950 and 2000.\n\nThe majority of the global population lives on the Asian continent, as a statistic of the shows.

At this time, all of these areas were under the control of the Roman Empire, and remained so until the fifth century. The Mediterranean region was the center of trade between Europe, Asia, and Africa throughout most of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and many of the most populous cities in the Europe were located in present-day Italy or Spain during this time. Due to this fact, these metropolitan areas were some of the most severely-hit during pandemic outbreaks. The emergence of Europe's maritime empires during the 16th and 17th centuries, and later the economic growth of Germany, led to a shift in Western Europe's population distribution; yet, over half of the population was located in these Mediterranean countries until the 19 century."

In 2022, the poverty level across all races and ethnicities was 11.5 percent. Historically, whites generally had the lowest poverty rates. However the poverty rate among Asian Americans was below that of whites in most years of the 2010s.\n\nIn contrast, Black Americans were the ethnic group with the highest share of their population living in poverty in almost every year since 1974. In 1979 alone, Black poverty was well over double the national average, and over four times the poverty rate in white communities; in 1982, almost 48 percent of the Black population lived in poverty. Although poverty rates have been trending downward across all ethnic groups, 17 percent of Black Americans and 20 percent of American Indian and Alaskan Natives still lived below the poverty line in 2022."

In the forty years between 2010 and 2050, it is projected that the landscape of world religions will undergo some noticeable changes, with the number of Muslims almost catching up to Christians. The changes in population sizes of each religious group is largely dependent on demographic development, for example, the rise in the world's Christian population will largely be driven by population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, while Muslim populations will rise across various regions of Africa and South Asia. As India's population is set to grow while China's goes into decline, this will be reflected in the fact that Hindus will outnumber the unaffiliated by 2050. In fact, India may be home to both the largest Hindu and Muslim populations in the world by the middle of this century."

In spite of the war, the Spanish population continued to grow throughout these years, and reached 28 million by the middle of the century. Between the 1950s and 1970s, Spain observed a significant increase in its population growth, facilitated by the baby boom that followed the Second World War (as in most of Western Europe) as well as general medical improvements and increased life expectancy.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Spain would begin a demographic transition marked by a , resulting in the population only growing by two million between the mid-1980s and 2000 (compared to an increase of two million every five or six years beforehand).

The population of the archipelago would grow steadily throughout the 19th century, reaching almost 6.5 million people by 1900. However, the population would begin to rise much more rapidly following the country\u2019s independence from the United States in 1946, as post-war economic aid from the United States and expansive modernization projects by the Philippine government would lead to a significant rise in standards of living and result in a post-war baby boom. This growth would remain steady well into the 21st century, and while the rate of population growth has fallen somewhat in recent years, the population of the Philippines is expected to continue its increase in the coming years, and in 2020, the Philippines is estimated to have a population of just under 110 million, which is almost twelve times larger than the Philippines' population in 1920."

            "Description": "In 1810, the region of present-day Venezuela had a population of approximately 720,000 people. Despite beginning this period with a war of independence and spending much of the latter half of the 19th century embroiled in several civil wars, the population of Venezuela would continue to increase steadily in this century, reaching the three million mark in 1910.\nOil boom\nFrom the late 1910s onwards, Venezuela's economic and demographic development would become inextricably linked to its booming oil industry. By the 1930s, Venezuela had become the world's largest exporter of oil; although it was overtaken by the U.S. and Soviet Union following the Second World War, Venezuela was a founding member of , and . This boom resulted in a large wave of migration from Europe and other regions of the Americas, as well as economic investment and influence from the U.S. government and the \"seven sisters\" oil companies. The Colombian crisis of the late 20 century also resulted in a wave of mass migration to Venezuela, which began in the 1980s; by the early 2000s it was estimated that displaced Colombians constituted one seventh of the total Venezuelan population.\n\nVenezuela's population growth continued into the 21 century, and by 2015, the population would peak at just over thirty million people. In the past five years, however, it is estimated that Venezuela's population has dropped by over 1.5 million (or five percent). The reason for this decline can be traced back to the economic mismanagement and radical leftist policies of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez; the first half of Ch\u00e1vez's term was characterized socioeconomic progress that improved the healthcare system and quality of life of most Venezuelans, however, the second half saw his regime become increasingly authoritarian and oppressive, and economically unsustainable. Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, but his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, continued upon the trajectory of the Ch\u00e1vez administration, which led to mass protests, and, eventually, one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world. Some estimates suggest that the weight of the average Venezuelan had , and that ninety percent of the population was living in poverty by 2018. As of 2019, , and this number is expected to rise above six million in the next year. As the crisis continues, Venezuelan population has continued to fall, and in 2020, it is estimated that approximately 28.4 million people live in the country."
