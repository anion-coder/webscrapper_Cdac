In 2020, the literacy rate, which is defined as people aged 15 and above who can read and write, had reached about 97.15 percent in China.\n\nGlobal literacy rates\nBy 2020, around 86.8 percent of the world population aged 15 years and above had been able to read and write. While in developed regions this figure ranged a lot higher, only around 67 percent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa was literate. Countries with the lowest literacy rates are also the most underdeveloped worldwide. According to UNESCO, literacy is a human right, especially in a fast-changing and technology-driven world. In China, the literacy rate has developed from 79 percent in 1982 to 97 percent in 2020, indicating that almost one million people per year had become literate over three decades. In India, the situation was entirely different. of merely 76 percent in 2022.\n\nThe dramatic increase in literacy in China has a lot to do with the efficacy of numerous political, economic and educational policies. In 1982, compulsory education was written into the Chinese constitution, postulating a nine-year compulsory education funded by the government. As is shown by the graph above, there was a large gender gap in literacy rate in China as of 1982. Though this gap still existed in 2020, it was narrowed down to three percent, starting from 28 percent in 1982. Since 1990, the national education policy was directed at females, especially from poor and/or minority families. Over the past years, China has achieved gender parity in primary schooling.\n\nHowever, in China should not to be overlooked. Regions with a strong economic background tend to display illiteracy rates below national average. In contrast, economically underdeveloped regions have a much larger share of people who cannot read nor write. Tibet for instance, a region where 92 percent of the , showed the highest illiterate rate nationwide, with around 34 percent in 2022."

This disparity although present in most countries, differs widely in its severity.\nIn 2019, 13 percent of users with low formal education in Greece uploaded self-created content, this constituted a decrease of one percent since 2017. Users with medium or higher education tended to share content online frequently too. According to the survey only 38 percent of people with a medium level of formal education and a mere 53 percent of users with a high degree of formal education share self-created content online. The gap between people with lower and higher formal education was 40 percent."

Immigrant students in Europe often fall behind the children of native-born parents, whether this is because of language difficulties, more difficult living situations at home, or through the lack of durable social networks in the country where they recieve their education. As of 2018, Finland was the country in Europe where immigrant children had the greatest difference in mean reading scores when compared with non-immigrant children, after accounting for gender and the students' and schools' socio-economic profile. This means that an equivalent immigrant child will achieve a mean reading score 74 points below that of a non-immigrant child. \n\nSeveral countries in Europe perform far better in this indicator, however, with the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and Germany - all countries with large immigrant populations - having differences of less than 20 points. Cyprus and Serbia were the only two countries in Europe in 2018 which showed the reverse trend: in these countries immigrants performed better than non-immigrant students by several points. "

            "Description": "One of the key ways in which disadvantage is transmitted from one generation to another is through missed educational opportunities. Immigrant students in Europe often fall behind the children of native-born parents, whether this is because of language difficulties, more difficult living situations at home, or through the lack of durable social networks in the country where they recieve their education. As of 2018, Finland was the country in Europe where immigrant children had the greatest difference in mean reading scores when compared with non-immigrant children, after accounting for gender and the students' and schools' socio-economic profile. This means that an equivalent immigrant child will achieve a mean reading score 74 points below that of a non-immigrant child. \n\nSeveral countries in Europe perform far better in this indicator, however, with the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and Germany - all countries with large immigrant populations - having differences of less than 20 points. Cyprus and Serbia were the only two countries in Europe in 2018 which showed the reverse trend: in these countries immigrants performed better than non-immigrant students by several points. "

According to a recent survey, the main issue with online education according to parents of middle school children was the reduction in social relations. Other problems mentioned by more than half of the respondents were a worsening emotional state of children, less interactions between the pupils and the teachers, and a decrease in study motivation. Similar worries were shared by parents ofvelementary and high school children."

The number of academic staff teaching in these fields has remained stable in recent years in Israel . The country\u2019s higher education system consists of ten universities and 58 colleges, geographically dispersed throughout the country.\n\nStrong focus on technology-oriented studies\nThe motivation to join the internationally renowned high-tech workforce in Israel is high, as evidenced by the number of academic staff in these fields as well as evident by the 26,547 students enrolled in this field , which constituted the most popular field of education in Israeli universities in the 2020/21 academic year. The demand for degrees in these fields has increased due to the high wages in the high-tech sector, which were double the national average in 2016. In 2021, the leading high-tech industries by number of employees were computer programming, computer product manufacturing and engineering as well as science research and development. They accounted for nearly 78 percent of all high-tech employees that year.\n\nAlthough the high-tech sector in Israel still plays a significant role in the country's economy and identity as a \"start-up nation\", a certain decline has started in the number of investments over the past two years. The number of exit deals for startups in the country also dropped from 270 in 2021 to only 132 in 2022. With only 43 exit deals in the first half of 2023, about half of the 83 in the first half of the previous year 2022, this year does not seem to be positive either."

In the center of the table is usually \"\" (diffuse), which is the largest individual group and is comprised of the transition metals. \"\" (principal) is the most diverse, it includes five separate groups and is found on the right of the table. Finally, \"\" (fundamental) is the lanthanides and actinides, which are generally not considered to follow the sequence shown in the 18 column table, and are usually displayed separately and below the table (although they are sometimes put in sequence in a 32 column table as part of the 6 and 7 rows)."

Thereafter, the elements are often color-coded to separate them into blocks and chemical groups, which corresponds more with their chemical properties and characteristics.\n\nIn most cases the table is split into four blocks, with ten separate groups. \"s-block\" (sharp) is displayed on the left of the table and includes alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, as well as hydrogen (a nonmetal) and helium (a noble gas, usually displayed on the right). In the center of the table is usually \"\" (diffuse), which is the largest individual group and is comprised of the transition metals. \"\" (principal) is the most diverse, it includes five separate groups and is found on the right of the table. Finally, \"\" (fundamental) is the lanthanides and actinides, which are generally not considered to follow the sequence shown in the 18 column table, and are usually displayed separately and below the table (although they are sometimes put in sequence in a 32 column table as part of the 6 and 7 rows)."

After completing their undergraduate studies, twenty U.S. presidents attended a graduate school, with eleven attaining a qualification (seven of which were law degrees). Only eight U.S. presidents, including two of the most highly regarded, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, did not attend college, while all presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower have attained some form of degree or equivalent qualification.\n\nHarvard University, the oldest institution of higher education in the U.S., has the highest number of presidential alumni, with eight in total. Of the eight schools, widely regarded as the most prestigious universities in the United States, five include U.S. presidents among their alumni, and fifteen U.S. presidents have attained a qualification these universities. Only two U.S. presidents have studied abroad; they were John Quincy Adams, who studied at Leiden University in the Netherlands while his father was stationed in Europe, and Bill Clinton, who studied at Oxford University in England. John F. Kennedy had planned to study at the London School of Economics, but fell ill after enrolling and transferred stateside to Princeton, before illness again forced his withdrawal a few months later. Two U.S. presidents founded universities; the University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson (and attended by Woodrow Wilson), and the State University of New York at Buffalo was founded by Millard Fillmore; one of the eight U.S. presidents who never attended college. Donald Trump did establish a company called \"Trump University\" in 2004, however this provided training for potential property realtors, and was not an educational institution (in 2016, Trump paid 25 million U.S. dollars to settle a lawsuit with the State of New York, as Trump University was deemed to have defrauded customers and made false statements).\n\nIn 1751, John Adams was the first future-president to go to college, entering Harvard at the age of sixteen, and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1755. The most recent presidential graduate is Barack Obama, who attended Occidental College from 1979 to 1981, before transferring to Columbia University where he majored in political science, graduating in 1983; Obama later obtained his in 1991. Woodrow Wilson is the only U.S. president to have obtained a Ph.D., which he received from Johns Hopkins University in 1886 for his work titled \"Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics\", and George W. Bush is the only U.S. president to have attained an MBA degree. , with both Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduating from West Point Military Academy, and Jimmy Carter graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy (Eisenhower also attended three other U.S. Army colleges during his military career, which began in 1915 and ended in 1969). Incumbent President Donald Trump obtained a B.S. in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968."

This disparity although present in most countries, differs widely in its severity.\nIn 2020, 72 percent of internet users in Sweden between 16 and 24 responded that they used the internet to access online new sites, newspapers, or news magazines. Even more, 92 percent of the 25- to 34-year-olds used the internet in 2020 to inform themselves about news. Users among the 35- to 44-year-olds is similarly high, while users aged between 45 and 54 years were less likely to inform themselves on the internet. Least likely were people aged between 55 and 64 years old, with only 82 percent responding that they used the internet as a source for news information. This however this number has increased by five percent since 2014."

From 2004 to 2008 there was some adjustment to the terminology used, however in 2009 the areas of safety and security, aeronautics and education, received their own specific allocation of the NASA budget.\n\nNASA in the noughties\nMuch of NASA's focus in the 2000s remained on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle Program. With the arrival of the first crew members of the ISS on November 2, 2000, this marked the beginning of the longest continuously manned-operation in low-earth orbit. The station is still under construction, and many of the Space Shuttle's missions in the and 2000s were to bring materials, components and cargo to the ISS. The Space Shuttle Program suffered a huge loss on February 1 2003 with the Columbia disaster. 17 years after the explosion of the Challenger in , the Columbia space shuttle disintegrated upon re-entry into the earths atmosphere, due to a piece of insulation foam breaking off and damaging a wing. All seven crew members on board died.\n\n\nIn 2006 NASA began offering commercial contracts to other agencies, such as Space X, Boeing and Orbital Sciences Corporation. This marked a new era in US space operations, as these private companies could now begin working on already-existing NASA programs, such as delivering supplies to the ISS, and potentially offering space tourism to private individuals. These supply missions began in 2012, and on June 7, NASA announced that it would launch a private journeys to the ISS, planned to cost 35 thousand U.S dollars per day, per astronaut."

According to the OECD\u2019s last report, Norway is one of the countries with the highest public expenditure on education.

On the other hand, the number of female students in teacher training in 2018 has only increased by close to 50 percent since 2008.

Whereas slightly more than 30 thousand students chose teacher trainings as their field of study in 2008, close to 48 thousand students chose the field in 2018. The positive development is not only due to the study programs becoming increasingly more popular, it is also due to the growing capacities at Norwegian universities and perhaps due to an overall focus on education in Norway. According to the OECD\u2019s last report, Norway is one of the countries with the highest public expenditure on education. Perhaps consequently, the share of Norwegians with upper secondary or tertiary education is over 80 percent.\n\n\n\nAlthough less than a third of all students in teacher training in 2018 were male students (about 28 percent), the yearly number of male students in teacher training programs has almost doubled since 2008. On the other hand, the number of female students in teacher training in 2018 has only increased by close to 50 percent since 2008. This means that the overall share of male students in this field of study has increased.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, or college universities in Norway, whereas 45 thousand were students of teacher training and pedagogy, which amounted to roughly 15 percent of the overall number of students. Although the number of students in teacher training is increasing, the overall number of students in Norway is close to constant."

Indiscriminate shootings, where the shooter intends to kill as many people as possible with no particular target, have also been highlighted as a significant source of harm in K-12 schools, with approximately 550 victims either wounded or killed within the provided time period. In comparison, school shootings attributed to anger over getting bad grades or facing disciplinary measures typically lead to a scenario in which teachers or school administrators are the primary targets of school shooters. Totaling less than 100 victims, this type of situation also encompasses shootings carried out by school employees against coworkers or superiors after poor performance evaluations, suspensions, or job losses."

The Framework identified seven target areas for improvement, which were early childhood, schooling, health, economic participation, healthy homes, safe communities, and governance and leadership. Only early childhood and schooling were considered to be on target in 2020. Child care enrollment rates were steadily increasing and . However, the states and territories with the seemed more likely to lag behind.\n\n\n\nAnother target of the Closing the Gap Framework, which is closely interlinked with education, is the economic participation target.
